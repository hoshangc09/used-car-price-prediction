# Used Car Price Prediction Model

## Overview

This GitHub repository contains a predictive model for used car pricing, designed to help used car dealerships optimize their inventory and pricing strategies. The model identifies significant factors that affect used car pricing, enabling informed decision-making to enhance profitability.

## CRISP-DM Framework

This project follows the CRISP-DM process, a standard in the industry for data projects, encompassing:

1. Business Understanding
2. Data Understanding
3. Data Preparation
4. Modeling
5. Evaluation
6. Deployment

## Repository Structure

- `data/`: Folder containing the dataset used for modeling.

## Usage

To run the model and generate predictions:

1. Ensure all dependencies are installed from `requirements.txt`.
2. Run the preprocessing script to prepare your new data: `python scripts/preprocess.py`
3. Load the model using `pickle` or `joblib` and pass in the preprocessed data for predictions.

## Business Insights

The model points to the year of manufacture, fuel type, car condition, and engine size as key predictors of pricing. Additionally, regional factors have been noted to impact the vehicle value.

## Model Limitations

The current models are constrained by computational limits. Future enhancements will address these limitations by expanding datasets, employing advanced algorithms, and conducting thorough hyperparameter tuning.

## For Used Car Dealerships

- Focus on newer models and cars in good condition.
- Adjust prices based on fuel type and engine size.
- Utilize the model's insights to sharpen your pricing strategy.

## Implementation

- Incorporate model insights into pricing tools.
- Develop a dashboard for instant pricing recommendations.
- Perform periodic reviews to adjust to market conditions.

## Support

- A guide on interpreting and applying model outputs is available.
- Training sessions for staff on using new tools and processes will be provided.
- Ongoing support through quarterly model performance reviews.
