# Used Car Price Prediction Model

## Overview

This repository hosts a Jupyter notebook that outlines the creation of a predictive model for used car pricing. Aimed at assisting used car dealerships, this model helps in understanding the critical factors influencing vehicle prices, thereby guiding inventory and pricing decisions.

## CRISP-DM Framework

The project is structured around the CRISP-DM methodology, ensuring a systematic approach to data mining that includes:

1. Business Understanding
2. Data Understanding
3. Data Preparation
4. Modeling
5. Evaluation
6. Deployment

## Repository Contents

- `vehicles-1.csv` to `vehicles-5.csv`: Partial datasets for the modeling.
- `Used_Car_Pricing_Prediction.ipynb`: The main Jupyter notebook with the analysis and modeling steps.

## Getting Started

To interact with the predictive model:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install all required packages listed in `requirements.txt`.
3. Execute the Jupyter notebook to view the model-building process and tweak as needed.

## Insights for Dealerships

Key takeaways for dealerships include the importance of a vehicle's manufacturing year, condition, fuel type, and engine size in determining its market price. The model also recognizes the influence of regional preferences on car valuation.

## Model Development and Limitations

The models presented are the initial iterations and are subject to computational limitations. Future work will involve expanding the dataset, refining models, and optimizing parameters to enhance predictive accuracy.

## Usage in Practice

Dealerships can integrate the model's insights into their pricing mechanisms or leverage a dashboard for real-time pricing guidance, subject to further development based on the model's findings.

## Support and Collaboration

Guidance on model interpretation, staff training for process integration, and quarterly reviews for model updates are part of the ongoing support plan.
